# MedTeach

We aim to use machine learning methodology to improve the experience of a medical
student. This app allows a user to toggle different levels of a certain diagnosable
metrics which then are used to predict the likelihood of a disease using large
data sets of previous patients, helping students have a better gauge of the extent
of the disease.

We built a web app using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and simulated machine learning algorithms on practice data to see the likelihood of heart and breast related diseases.
